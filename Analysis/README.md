This File will contain a description of every variable saved by the experiment. This text file should be updated everytime a variable is changed or a nerw one is saved. This will be referenced during data analysis. 

1. reliability_questplus.m
	1. Check performance across staircase interactions for staircasemode2
	2. Can be run independently 
2. fitPsychFunc_01.m
	1. Fit your PF and needs to be run prior to other scripts
	2. Plots bar plots for individual subjects(sensitivity, bias magnitude)
	3. Figure Output: psychometric functions per condition (individual subject level)
3. plotBars_02.m
	1. Plots bar plots for aggregate (RT, sensitivity, bias magnitude)
	2. Also computes sensitivity difference (% increase)
	3. Also computes LME
